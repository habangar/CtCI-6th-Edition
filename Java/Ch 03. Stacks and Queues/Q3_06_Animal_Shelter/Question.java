/**
 * Animal Shelter: An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis.
 * People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter,
 * or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest anmal of that type)
 * They cannot selet which specific animal they would like.
 * Create the dat structture to maintain this sytem and implement operations such as enquue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat.
 * You may use the build-in LinkedList data structure.
 * Hinits: 22, 56, 63
